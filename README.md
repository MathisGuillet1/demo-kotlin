# Workshop: From Java to Kotlin

The code contained in this repository is intended to be used for the sake of a workshop demonstration for people willing
to move from Java to Kotlin.

It provides code samples written in Java and their equivalent written in Kotlin.

The goal of this repository is **NOT** to demonstrate a Spring Boot project with great standards. All code is written
only for the sake of showcasing differences between the two languages.

Languages versions used in this repository:

* Java: 21
* Kotlin: 2.0.10

The project was bootstrapped with [spring initilizr](https://start.spring.io/) (Spring Boot v3.3.2).

## Kotlin in 15 minutes for JVM developers

Here are some resources useful for Java/Scala/Groovy developers.

If you have only 15 minutes to start reading Kotlin code:

## Kotlin and Spring

If you are willing to write Kotlin for a Spring Boot application, both Spring and Spring Boot documentation provide Java
and Kotlin samples:
