# Workshop from Java to Kotlin

This material in this repository is intended to be used for the sake of a workshop demonstration for people willing to
move from Java to Kotlin.   
It provides some sample code written in Java and an equivalent written in Kotlin.

The goal of this repository is **NOT** to demonstrate a Spring Boot project with great standards. All code is written
only for the sake of showcasing differences.

## Kotlin in 15 minutes for JVM developers

I am new to Kotlin and I am a Java/Scala developer, I need to understand the basics.

I have only 15 minutes to start reading Kotlin code :

[Kotlin basics in 15 minutes](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-syntax.html#creating-classes-and-instances)
or
[Kotlin in 15 minutes by Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/kotlin/intro)

## Kotlin Documentation

I am developing with Kotlin and I need help with concepts.

[Kotlin concepts](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)

I want to check something in standard library documentation.

[Kotlin stdlib documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/)

## Kotlin and Spring

I need spring documentation with Kotlin examples.

No worries, Spring and Spring boot documentation both provides Java and Kotlin samples :
